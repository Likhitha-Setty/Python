# Python Assignment – Basic Concepts

This repository contains two simple Python programs that demonstrate user input, arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and output formatting. These scripts are part of Assignment 1 for Module 2: Basic Python Concepts.

Program 1 – Basic Mathematical Operations (`program-1.py`)

### Description:
This program:
- Prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- Performs the following operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with zero-division check)
- Displays the result of each operation clearly.

### Sample Output:

Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Addition: 15.0
Subtraction: 5.0
Multiplication: 50.0
Division: 2.0


## Program 2 – Personalized Greeting (`program-2.py`)

### Description:
This program:
- Takes the user's first and last name as input.
- Concatenates them to form a full name.
- Displays a personalized greeting using the full name.

### Sample Output:
Enter your first name: Likhitha
Enter your last name: Setty
Hello, Likhitha Setty! Welcome to the world of Python.

##  How to Run
